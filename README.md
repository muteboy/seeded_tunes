# Seeded Tunes - seeded_tunes

This is a project to take a single seed number and generate:

* information about a fictional "music scene"
  * with multiple fictional "record labels"...
    * with multiple fictional "artists" attached...
      * each with multiple fictional "albums" released...
        * each with multiple tracks

**_With a single seed, a whole music scene and discography is created!_**

The scene has:

* a range of years of activity

The label has:

* a range of years during which they were active
* personnel generated by selection from lists

Each artist has:

* a name generated using a random word list
* personnel generated by selection from lists
* a range of years during which they were active
* a number of albums

Each album by each artist has:

* a title generated using random words
* a year of release
* abstract artwork generated in SVG and [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org)

Each track on each album has:

* a title generated using random words
* generated music files created for use in isobar which will create actual music.

The label, artists, people, and albums will also be represented on a "Rock Family Tree", of the style created by [Pete Frame](https://familyofrock.net/)
